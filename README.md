# widgets_django
A basic django backend linked to a MySQL database. The VS Code debugging and terminal integration is included for reference but would normally be added to the gitignore file

The database and a user will need to be created. The user's credentials and schema name should then be saved with the corresponding environment variables referenced in settings.py
